## Welcome to Bolour Computing - Azad Bolour's Software Workshop

We are artisan builders with deep technical knowledge and decades of experience.
We partner with you to deliver highly reliable, scalable, and evolvable business systems.

We build software by using these practices 

- system decomposition to small, loosely-coupled, pluggable, and highly testable components

- iterative and incremenatl development and delivery

- minimal ceremony 

- continuous, direct, informal communication between all stake holders

- learning by prototyping small selected parts of the system 

- up-front homework on the requirements and conceptual foundation of the system so we can start off on a sound architectural path

We have been in business since 1987, and have served a variety of clients over the years.

To see a representative sample of our work, head on over to 
[the eagerwords game site](https://eagerwords.com), and test your 
vocabulary recall against the program.

_Eagerwords_ uses a Scala/Play/Postgresql server, and ReactJS client.
It is [open-sourced on gihub](https://github.com/azadbolour/eagerwords.com) and
deployed on AWS.
